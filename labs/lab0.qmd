This lab will introduce you to the course computing workflow. The main goal is to get you setup with git in GitHub, link GitHub with RStudio and play around with a few basics.

::: callout-important
This lab will not be graded.
:::

::: callout-note
Git is a version control system (like "Track Changes" features from Microsoft Word but more powerful) and GitHub is the home for your git-based projects on the internet (like DropBox but much better).
:::

By the end of the lab, you will...

-   Be familiar with the workflow using R, RStudio, Git, and GitHub
-   Gain practice writing a reproducible report using Quarto
-   Practice version control using GitHub

# Getting started

::: callout-important
Your lab TA will lead you through the Getting Started section.
:::

## Log in to RStudio

-   Go to <https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers> and login with your Duke NetID and Password.
-   Click `STA323` to log into the Docker container. You should now see the RStudio environment.

::: callout-warning
If you haven't yet done so, you will need to reserve a container for `STA323` first.
:::

## Set up your SSH key

You will authenticate GitHub using SSH. Below are an outline of the authentication steps; you are encouraged to follow along as your TA demonstrates the steps.

::: callout-note
You only need to do this authentication process one time on a single system.
:::

-   Type `credentials::ssh_setup_github()` into your console.
-   R will ask "No SSH key found. Generate one now?" You should click 1 for yes.
-   You will generate a key. It will begin with "ssh-rsa...." R will then ask "Would you like to open a browser now?" You should click 1 for yes.
-   You may be asked to provide your GitHub username and password to log into GitHub. After entering this information, you should paste the key in and give it a name. You might name it in a way that indicates where the key will be used, e.g., `sta323`).

You can find more detailed instructions [here](https://github.com/DukeStatSci/github_auth_guide) if you're interested.

## Configure Git

There is one more thing we need to do before getting started on the assignment. Specifically, we need to configure your git so that RStudio can communicate with GitHub. This requires two pieces of information: your name and email address.

To do so, you will use the `use_git_config()` function from the `usethis` package. (And we also need to install a package called `gert` just for this step.)

Type the following lines of code in the **console** in RStudio filling in your name and the email address associated with your GitHub account.

```{r}
devtools::install_github("r-lib/gert")

usethis::use_git_config(
  user.name = "Your name", 
  user.email = "Email associated with your GitHub account"
  )
```

For example, mine would be

```{r}
devtools::install_github("r-lib/gert")

usethis::use_git_config(
  user.name = "Alexander Fisher", 
  user.email = "alexander.fisher@duke.edu"
  )
```

You are now ready interact with GitHub via RStudio!

## Clone the repo & start new RStudio project

-   Go to the course organization at [github.com/sta323-sp23](https://github.com/sta323-sp23) organization on GitHub. Click on the repo with the prefix **lab-0**. It contains the starter documents you need to complete the lab.

-   Click on the green **CODE** button, select **Use SSH** (this might already be selected by default, and if it is, you'll see the text **Clone with SSH**). Click on the clipboard icon to copy the repo URL.

-   In RStudio, go to **Project** in the upper-right. Click *New Project* -> *Version Control* -> *Git* and paste the SSH URL under "Repository URL". Select *Create Project*.

-   The R Project will open by default. In the future, you can open the project manually by clicking in the upper right, *Open Project*, and navigate to `lab-0.Rproj` from the drop-down menu.

-   Click *lab-0.qmd* to open the template Quarto file. This is where you will write up your code and narrative for the lab.

## R and R Studio

Below are the components of the RStudio IDE.

Below are the components of a Quarto (.qmd) file.

![](/slides/images/lab-0/quarto.png)

## YAML

The top portion of your R Markdown file (between the three dashed lines) is called **YAML**. It stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language". It is a human friendly data serialization standard for all programming languages. All you need to know is that this area is called the YAML (we will refer to it as such) and that it contains meta information about your document.

::: callout-important
Open the Quarto (`.qmd`) file in your project, change the author name to your name, and render the document. Examine the rendered document.
:::

## Committing changes

- In the **Terminal** pane of RStudio, type `pwd` to "print working directory", i.e. show where in the filesystem you are. You should see something like */home/guest/lab-0-username*. Next type `ls` to list files in the directory. You should see something similar:

```
lab-0.Rproj  README.md lab-0.qmd
```

- Type `git status` and press enter. You should see which files have been edited (highlighted in red). *lab-0.qmd* should be in red since you updated the YAML. 

- Type `git add lab-0.qmd`. This stages the file to be committed. In the future you can add several files to the same commit by repeating this step. You can type `git status` again to see the staged file (in green). Next type `git commit -m "updating YAML"`. This will commit the file with the message between quotes. 

- Finally `git push` to push the changes to the remote repository.

- Now let's make sure all the changes went to GitHub. Go to your GitHub repo and refresh the page. You should see your commit message next to the updated files. If you see this, all your changes are on GitHub and you're good to go!

## Exercises

For all exercises, you should respond in the space provided in the template `lab-0.qmd` and show all your work. This *lab-0* just has a few warm-up exercises to introduce you to some computing phenomena and general ideas.

1.  Floating point algebra.\
    \
    Do floating point numbers obey the rules of algebra? For example, one of the rules of algebra is additive association. `(x + y) + z == x + (y + z)`. Check if this true in `R` using $x = 0.1$, $y = 0.1$ and $z = 1$. **Explain what you find.**

Additional examples of floating point pecularity are provided below.

```{r cpu-arithmetic, eval=FALSE}
# example 1
0.2 == 0.6 / 3
# example 2
point3 <- c(0.3, 0.4 - 0.1, 0.5 - 0.2, 0.6 - 0.3, 0.7 - 0.4)
point3
point3 == 0.3
```

To work around these issues, you could use `all.equal()` for checking the equality of two double quantities in R. **What does `all.equal()` do?**

```{r cpu-arithmetic2, eval=FALSE}
# example 1, all.equal()
all.equal(0.2, 0.6 / 3)
# example 2, all.equal()
point3 <- c(0.3, 0.4 - 0.1, 0.5 - 0.2, 0.6 - 0.3, 0.7 - 0.4)
point3
all.equal(point3, rep(.3, length(point3)))
```

2.  Inefficient math. \
    \
    You've collected 10 million observations in a vector called `x` and you summarize the mean of your observations:

```{r }
set.seed(2)
n = 10000000
x = rnorm(n, 1, 10)
xbar = mean(x)
```

A new observation comes in `new_x = 15.0`.

```{r}
new_x = 15
updated_x = c(x, new_x)
```

Although it won't change much, you want to recompute the mean with this new data point. You could recompute the mean by re-running `mean()` on `updated_x` or you could observe that:

$$
\bar{x}_{n+1} = \frac{1}{n+1}(n \cdot\bar{x}_n + x_{n+1})
$$

Compare the time each method takes by surrounding each method with `system.time({})`.

```{r}
# method 1
mean(updated_x)
```

```{r}
#method 2
## program the equation above here and then time it with system.time({})

```

3.  Inefficient code. \
    \
    To quantify the inefficiency of a poorly written for loop, time both the code blocks below. Experiment with different values of n. What do you observe?

```{r}
# method 1
n <- 10
x <- 1
for (i in seq_len(n)) {
  x <- c(x, sqrt(x[i] * i))
}
```

```{r}
# method 2
n <- 10
x <- rep(1, n + 1)
for (i in seq_len(n)) {
  x[i + 1] <- sqrt(x[i] * i)
}
```

4.  Vector norms.

If $x$ and $y$ are scalar numbers, $x<y$ makes sense. How do you compare the size of two different vectors $x$ and $y$? A very typical way is the vector norm. The p-norm of vector $x$ of length $n$ is:

$$
||x||_p = \left( \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i |^p \right)^{1/p}
$$

for $p = 1, 2, ...$. For example, if $p = 2$ we have the *Euclidean norm*, also known as the $l_2$ (read "L-2") norm.

-   Verify that the Euclidean norm of $x = \left( 1, 2.5, -6.3 \right)$ is `6.851277` in R. You can compute the $l_1$ and $l_2$ norms in R using `norm(x, type = "1")` and `norm(x, type = "2")` respectively. Read the documentation, `?norm()` and you will see you need to make sure the argument `x` is a matrix.

-   Compare $||x||_2$ and $||y||_2$ where $y = \left(0.8, 2.4, -6.4 \right)$.

-   Compare $||x||_1$ and $||y||_1$, where again $x$ and $y$ are the vectors given above. Which is larger?

## Submitting your lab

For future lab assignments (this one isn't graded), you will submit your lab assignment by simply committing and pushing your completed `lab-x.qmd` to your GitHub repo. Your most recent commit 48 hours after the assignment deadline will be graded, and any applicable late penalty will be applied (see [the syllabus](/syllabus.html)).
