By the end of the lab, you will...

-   recreate plots starting from untidy data sets
-   create your own plotting tools
-   plot an admixture density

Make sure everyone in your team knows when to stop committing! After 5pm on the due date will result in late penalty applying for the team, even if commit is "accidentally" pushed.

# Getting started

-   In the *terminal* tab, type `cd ~` to navigate to your home directory. Next `git clone git@github.com:sta323-sp23/lab-3-username.git` where `username` is replaced with your username (this is the copied SSH URL from your lab-2 GitHub repo).

-   Navigate to your `lab-3` folder and open the `.Rproj` file.

-   Open the Quarto (`.qmd`) file, change the author name to your name.

## Exercises

For all exercises, you should respond in the space provided in the template `lab-3.qmd` and show all your work. In all answers of type `double`, three significant figures suffices.

### 1. Re-create the plot

Using the untidy data set `statsci.csv`, re-create the plot below. Pay attention to re-creating exactly all aspects of the plot, e.g. axes, labels, capitalization etc.

## Hint

-   Begin by making the data set tidy.
-   The colors used are: `"cadetblue4"`, `"cadetblue3"`, `"lightgoldenrod4"`, `"lightgoldenrod3"`.
-   The position of the legend is $(0.2, 0.8)$.
-   Double check that your plot renders nicely. The default should be fine, but you might need to adjust `fig-width` and `fig-height` YAML options [read here](https://quarto.org/docs/computations/execution-options.html).

### 2. Custom `ggplot` functionality

Create a new stat called `stat_outlier_encircle()` that encircles outliers in a set of bivariate data. Define an outlier as when both values in a data pair have a z-score greater than three in absolute value. Check out <https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/extending-ggplot2.html>.

Some examples of `stat_outlier_encircle()` in action are given below.

A typical scatter plot with `ggplot()` and `geom_point()`:

```{r}
# copy this code chunk and use this data for the exercise
library(tidyverse)
set.seed(09567899)
data_norm = tibble(x = c(rnorm(95, 100, 5), rnorm(5, 70, 5)), 
                    y = c(rnorm(95, 100, 5), rnorm(5, 70, 5)))

ggplot(data_norm, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal()
```

An added layer that marks outliers:

```{r}
#| eval: false
ggplot(data_norm, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_outlier_encircle() +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](img/lab3-plot1.png)

```{r}
#| eval: false
ggplot(data_norm, mapping = aes(x = x, y = y)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_outlier_encircle(color = "purple", size = 14, 
                        fill = "lightblue", alpha = .4) +
  theme_minimal()
```

![](img/lab3-plot2.png)

Create the new stat `stat_outlier_encircle()` so that the code chunks above give the output above.

## Hint

See [ggplot lecture](https://sta323-sp23.github.io/slides/lec07.html#/custom-ggplot-functions-with-ggproto) for a template and read the documentation [here](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/articles/extending-ggplot2.html) for help.

### 3. Admixture density plot

Plot the density of the admixture distribution you created in [lab 2](https://sta323-sp23.github.io/labs/lab2.html) case (iv). Overlay your plot on the histogram of lemur weights (find `lemurs.csv` in the data folder).

Create a second plot like you did above, but adjust $\mu_1$, $\mu_2$, $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ until your distribution fits the plot better. Report the values you choose for $\mu_1$, $\mu_2$, $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$. An example of such a fit is provided below. Your plot does **not** need to look exactly like the one below. Explain why you choose the values you do for $\mu_1$, $\mu_2$, $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$. \

::: callout-tip
## Hint
-   How can you make the y-axis of the histogram be on the "density" scale instead of the "count" scale?
-   Previously you created `rMyNormalMixture` function that randomly sampled from your distribution. Now you want to create a `dMyNormalMixture` function that returns the **density** of the function instead, see e.g. `dnorm` documentation.

## Style guidelines

All assignments in this course must employ proper coding style, as outlined below:

-   All code should obey the 80 character limit per line (i.e. no code should run off the page when rendering or require scrolling). To enable a vertical line in the RStudio IDE that helps guide this, see the style guidelines from lab 0 or ask a member of the teaching team for help.

-   All commas should be followed by a space.

-   All binary operators should be surrounded by space. For example `x + y` is appropriate. `x+y` is not.

-   All pipes `%>%` or `|>` as well as ggplot layers `+` should be followed by a new line.

-   You should be consistent with stylistic choices, e.g. only use 1 of `=` vs `<-` and `%>%` vs `|>`

-   Your name should be at the top (in the YAML) of each document under "author:"

-   All code chunks should be named (with names that don't have spaces, e.g. `ex-1`, `ex-2` etc.)

-   File names in your GitHub repo such as `lab-x.qmd` must not be changed and left as provided. Additionally, your repo must pass certain basic checks. The results of these checks are visible on GitHub via the badges at the top of your README and the actions tab. These are meant to give you feedback around the structure and reproducibility of your repository and assignment - they do not assess the correctness of your work. You should consider them a necessary but not sufficient condition when turning in your work - passing all of the checks simply means your have met a minimum standard of reproducibility for the assignment.

Fundamentally, the check is making sure 1) you only have the files you should in your repository, 2) your `.qmd` renders.

If you have any questions about style, please ask a member of the teaching team.

## Submitting your lab

To submit your assignment, simply commit and push your completed `lab-x.qmd` to your GitHub repo. Your most recent commit 48 hours after the assignment deadline will be graded, and any applicable late penalty will be applied (see [the syllabus](/syllabus.html)). For this reason, **do not push commits** after you are satisfied with your work, or a late penalty will be applied.
