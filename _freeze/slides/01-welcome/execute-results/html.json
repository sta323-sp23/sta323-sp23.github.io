All group members are expected to participate equally. Commit history may be used to give individual team members different grades. Your grade may differ from the rest of your group.\n\n## Sharing / reusing code\n\n-   Unless explicitly stated otherwise, this course's policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. Google, existing StackOverflow answers, etc.) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use or use as inspiration in your solution(s).\n\n-   Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism, regardless of source.\n\n-   Narrative (non-code solutions) should always be entirely your own.\n\n### Late policy\n\n-   Homeworks and labs can be turned in within 48 hours of the deadline for grade penalty (5% off per day).\n\n-   Exams and the final project cannot be turned in late and can only be excused under exceptional circumstances.\n\n-   The Duke policy for illness requires a short-term illness report or a letter from the Dean; except in emergencies, all other absenteeism must be approved in advance (e.g., an athlete who must miss class may be excused by prior arrangement for specific days). For emergencies, email notification is needed at the first reasonable time.\n\n-   Last minute coding/rendering issues will not be granted extensions.\n\n## Course toolkit\n\n| Resource                                                     | Description                                                  |\n|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| [course website](https://sta323-sp23.github.io/)             | course notes, deadlines, assignments, office hours, syllabus |\n| [Sakai](sakai.duke.edu)                                      | class recordings, solutions and announcements                |\n| [course organization](https://github.com/sta323-sp23)        | assignments, collaboration                                   |\n| [slack](https://sta323-sp23.slack.com)                       | primary communication                                        |\n| [RStudio containers](https://cmgr.oit.duke.edu/containers)\\* | online coding platform                                       |\n\nYou are welcome to install R and RStudio locally on your computer.

You will rarely work with the last two types - complex and raw.\n\n. . .\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- c(T, F, TRUE, FALSE)\ntypeof(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"logical\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ny <- c(\"a\", \"few\", \"more\", \"slides\")\ntypeof(y)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"character\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n::: callout-note\n`c()` is a function that combines arguments to form a vector. It's a quick way to make small vectors for testing and experimentation. Later, we'll see better ways to create vectors.\n:::\n\n## Coercion hierarchy\n\nIf you try to combine components of different types into a single atomic vector, R will try to coerce all elements so they can be represented as the simplest type. The ordering is `logical` \\< `integer` \\< `double` \\< `character`, where `logical` is considered the \"simplest\".\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- c(T, 5, F, 0, 1)\ny <- c(\"a\", 1, T)\nz <- c(3.0, 4L, 0L)\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: columns\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 1 5 0 0 1\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ny\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"a\"    \"1\"    \"TRUE\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nz\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 3 4 0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntypeof(x)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"double\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntypeof(y)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"character\"\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntypeof(z)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"double\"\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n:::\n:::\n\n## Logical operations\n\n### Boolean operations\n\n| Operator | Definition   | Vectorized? |\n|----------|--------------|-------------|\n| x \\| y   | or           | yes         |\n| x & y    | and          | yes         |\n| !x       | not          | yes         |\n| x \\|\\| y | or           | no          |\n| x && y   | and          | no          |\n| xor(x,y) | exclusive or | yes         |\n\n### Comparison operations\n\n| Operator | Definition            | Vectorized?  |\n|----------|-----------------------|--------------|\n| x \\< y   | less than             | yes          |\n| x \\<= y  | less than or equal to | yes          |\n| x != y   | not equal to          | yes          |\n| x == y   | equal to              | yes          |\n| x %in% y | is x contained in y   | yes (over x) |\n\n## Length coercion (vector recycling)\n\nThe shorter of two atomic vectors in an operation is recycled until it is the same length as the longer atomic vector.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx <- c(2, 4, 6)\ny <- c(1, 1, 1, 2, 2)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx > y\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1]  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE  TRUE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nx == y\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n10 / x\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] 5.000000 2.500000 1.666667\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Exercises\n\nWhat do each of the following return?
